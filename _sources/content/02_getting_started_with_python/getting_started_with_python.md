# 02 - <i class="fab fa-python"></i> Getting Started with Python and `uv`

## Lesson Overview

The goal of this section is to gain a basic understanding of:

1. What Python is.
2. How to install it (we will use `uv`) and where it "lives" on your computer.
3. How to run Python code.
4. What packages are and how to install them.
5. What virtual environments are, why they are useful, and how to create them.

We will focus on using [`uv`](#uv-cheat-sheet) to manage Python versions,
create virtual environments, and install packages.

## Notes

Here is a summary of some of the most useful commands and concepts that we cover
in the lecture for this section.

### Terminal commands

Here are some basic terminal commands that will help you use the
command line effectively.  These commands work for macOS,
Linux, and the Windows PowerShell terminal (but not the windows `cmd` Prompt).

```{tip}
Reminder, To open the terminal:

- On macOS, you can use the `Command + Space` shortcut to
open Spotlight, then type "Terminal" and hit `Enter`.
- On Windows, you can use the `Windows + R` shortcut to open the Run dialog,
then type "powershell" and hit `Enter`.
```

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:100px;">Command</span>  | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **`ls`** | List directory contents. |
| **`cd [DIR]`** | Change directory to `[DIR]`. <br><small>_If `[DIR]` is not provided, defaults to the home directory._</small> |
| **`pwd`** | Print the current working directory. |
| **`mkdir [DIR]`** | Create a new directory named `[DIR]`. |

```{tip}
When using relative paths, you can use `..` to refer to the parent directory,
and `.` to refer to the current directory.
```

### `uv` cheat sheet

[`uv`]((https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)) is a fast, one-stop-shop for managing
Python versions, virtual environments, and packages.  It is an _excellent_ tool
to learn if you want to get started quickly with Python.

Here are some common `uv` commands that will help you get started using Python
with `uv`.  We will use them throughout this book.

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:275px;">Command</span>  | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **`uv help <COMMAND>`** | Useful way to get help on a specific `<COMMAND>`. |
| **`uv venv [ENV_PATH]`** | Create a virtual environment at the specified `ENV_PATH`.<br><small>üëç _If `[ENV_PATH]` is not provided, defaults to `.venv` in the current directory_.</small> |
| <i class="fab fa-apple"></i> `source .venv/bin/activate`<br><i class="fab fa-windows"></i> `.venv\Scripts\activate` | Activate the virtual environment in the path `.venv` |
| **`uv pip install   [PACKAGE]`**<br>**`uv pip uninstall [PACKAGE]`** | Install or uninstall `PACKAGE` in the current virtual environment.  May use multiple packages separated by space. |
| **`uv pip list`** | List all installed packages in the current virtual environment. |
| <hr> | <hr> |
| **`uv run script.py`** | Run a Python script `script.py` in an on-demand virtual environment. See details [below](#uv-run) |
| <a name="uvx"></a>**`uvx <COMMAND>`**<br>_short for:_<br>**`uv tool run <COMMAND>`**<br>  | Run a `<COMMAND>` provided by a Python package _of the same name_. <br>‚ú® _This creates an environment, installs the package, and then invokes the command all in one step!_</small> |
| **`uv <COMMAND> -p <PYTHON>`** | Use the specified version of python (e.g. `-p 3.10`).<br><small>_This flag works with `uv tool run`, and `uv venv` commands._</small> |

<small>_... For complete docs, see [Getting started with
uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/)._</small>

```{note}
While we will not be covering it here, `uv` is also frequently used for
[**project management**](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/).  If you
see references to commands like `uv init`, `uv sync`, `uv add`, or `uv remove`,
these are only relevant in the context of using `uv` for project management.
```

### `uv` ‚ÜîÔ∏è `conda` translation table

```{tip}
If you are already familiar with `conda`, here is a quick translation table to
help you understand how `uv` commands map to `conda` commands:

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:235px;">`uv` command</span> | <span style="display: inline-block; width:140px;">`conda` equivalent</span>  | Description |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------- |
| **`uv venv`** | **`conda create`** | Create a new env |
| **`source .venv/bin/activate`**<br>**`.venv\Scripts\activate`** | **`conda activate`** | Activate the virtual environment in the path `.venv` |
| **`uv pip install`** | **`conda install`** | Install a package into the env |
| **`uv pip uninstall`** | **`conda remove`** | Remove a package from the env |
| **`uv pip list`** | **`conda list`** | List all packages in the env |
```

### `uv run`

`uv run` is a command that allows you to run a command or script in an on-demand
virtual environment.

If you have a simple python script named `hello.py`, that has _no_ dependencies:

```python
print("Hello, world!")
```

You can run it with:

```bash
uv run hello.py
```

... which is shorthand for `uv run python hello.py`.

<small>_... For complete docs, see
[Running scripts](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/)._</small>

### `uv run` with additional dependencies

A particulary useful feature of `uv run` is that you can specify dependencies
_in your script_ using a special syntax in a comment at the top of the file.

For example, the following `example_script.py` uses _two_ packages, `requests`
and `rich`, to download and print a JSON file downloaded from the internet in a
nice format:

```python
# /// script
# dependencies = ["requests<3", "rich"]
# ///

import requests
from rich import print

resp = requests.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts")
print(resp.json())
```

With `uv` you can run this script _without_ having to first create an
environment and install the necessary dependencies, simply
by running:

```bash
uv run example_script.py
```

dependencies](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/scripts/#declaring-script-dependencies)._</small>

### Running Jupyter notebooks with `juv`

üí° _Think of `juv` as `uv run` for Jupyter notebooks._

`juv` is a command line tool built on top of `uv` that provides a
convenient way to run a Jupyter notebook, with all the necessary
dependencies, in an on-demand virtual environment.

It is built on the following concepts:

1. As we saw [above](#uvx): `uvx juv` is shorthand for "run the
   command `juv` from the package `juv`.
2. As we saw [above](#uv-run-with-additional-dependencies): `uv` can read
   dependencies specified inside of a script.
3. `juv` just brings along the necessary Jupyter notebook dependencies and
   parses the dependencies from the top of your notebook for `uv`.

| <span style="display: inline-block; width:310px;">Command</span>  | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **`uvx juv init <name.ipynb>`** | Initialize a new Jupyter notebook named `<name.ipynb>`. |
| **`uvx juv add <name.ipynb> <PACKAGE>`** | Add a new dependency to the comment at the top of `<name.ipynb>`. |
| **`uvx juv run <name.ipynb>`** | Launch a Jupyter notebook server and run the notebook `<name.ipynb>`. |

<small>_... For complete docs, see the [`juv` repository](https://github.com/manzt/juv)._</small>
