    "**Concept.**  \n",
    "In many applications, one will write Python code that does many different tasks. The code can get quite long, which makes it harder to read through and catch mistakes, or repurpose for a different application later. To organize code by tasks in Python, we use *functions*. A *function* is a block of code that does a specific task. It is organized to have a *name*, *inputs (parameters)*, and *outputs (return values)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to write a function\n",
    "We structure functions in Python as follows: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters): \n",
    "    # do task here\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "In this function, `function_name` is the name of the function, `parameters` are inputs that the function will use to return `value` output. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the function by **calling** it. That can be done as follows: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "function_name(arguments) # calling the function function_name and inputting parameters \"arguments\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "Note that `parameters` in the `function_name` definition is a placeholder for what you will actually want to input into the function. In the example above where we call the function `function_name`, `arguments` is the actual input passed into the function to use to generate a `value` to return. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices for Labeling Functions\n",
    "When making new functions, it is good practice to add additional indicators about what the function does and what it inputs and outputs. Doing so will help make the code understandable to others and future you. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding a docstring\n",
    "We can add a `\"\"\"docstring\"\"\"` to describe what the function does. When the code is run, Python will ignore anything contained within the `\"\"\" \"\"\"` of the docstring.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters): \n",
    "    \"\"\"Description of what the function does here\"\"\"\n",
    "    # do task here\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Adding type labels\n",
    "We can also add `type` labels, which specify the data type, to the inputs and outputs of the function definition. These labels will make it easier to understand what data types the function is handling for inputs and outputs.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def function_name(parameters:type) -> type: \n",
    "    \"\"\"Description of what the function does here\"\"\"\n",
    "    # do task here\n",
    "    return value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functions with multiple inputs\n",
    "You can define a function with multiple inputs in Python by separating them with commas. Below is an example: \n",

    "def my_function(x:int, y:float) -> int: \n",
